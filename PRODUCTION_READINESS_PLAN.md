---

## üî• PHASE 1: CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES (DO FIRST)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days  
**Blocker**: Cannot launch without these fixes

### 1.1 Database Security - CRITICAL ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Issue #1: Loyalty Points Manipulation (ERROR)
**Risk**: Users can artificially inflate their reward points
**Impact**: Financial fraud, revenue loss

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Remove dangerous user update policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own loyalty points" ON public.loyalty_points;

-- Create read-only policy for users
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own loyalty points" ON public.loyalty_points
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Only system functions can modify points
CREATE POLICY "System can update loyalty points" ON public.loyalty_points
FOR UPDATE USING (false); -- No direct updates allowed
```

#### Issue #2: Customer PII Exposure (ERROR)
**Risk**: Personal information accessible without proper controls
**Impact**: GDPR violations, identity theft, data breach

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Strengthen profiles RLS
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON public.profiles
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Deny anonymous access explicitly
CREATE POLICY "Deny anonymous profile access" ON public.profiles
FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Same for shipping addresses
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own addresses" ON public.shipping_addresses;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own addresses" ON public.shipping_addresses
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### Issue #3: Bug Report Email Exposure (ERROR)
**Risk**: Anonymous users can view error reports by email
**Impact**: Email harvesting, vulnerability discovery

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Remove vulnerable anonymous policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anonymous users can view their own error reports by email" 
ON public.support_tickets_error_reports;

-- Require authentication
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users view own error reports" 
ON public.support_tickets_error_reports
FOR SELECT USING (
  auth.uid() IS NOT NULL 
  AND (user_id = auth.uid() OR public.is_admin_user(auth.uid()))
);
```

#### Issue #4: Payment Data Security (ERROR)
**Risk**: Service role policies too permissive
**Impact**: Payment fraud, PCI compliance failure

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Restrict service role payment policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can insert/update payments" ON public.payments;

-- More restrictive service role policy
CREATE POLICY "Validated service payment insert" ON public.payments
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() IS NULL -- Only service role (no user context)
  AND amount > 0
  AND currency IS NOT NULL
  AND stripe_payment_intent_id IS NOT NULL
);
```

### 1.2 Supabase Configuration Fixes - CRITICAL ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Go to Supabase Dashboard and fix:

1. **OTP Expiry** (Security)
   - Navigate to: Authentication ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí OTP Expiry
   - Change from current value to: **600 seconds (10 minutes)**
   - [Fix OTP Expiry](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xcvlijchkmhjonhfildm/auth/providers)

2. **Leaked Password Protection** (Security)
   - Navigate to: Authentication ‚Üí Policies
   - Enable: "Check against compromised password database"
   - [Enable Password Protection](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xcvlijchkmhjonhfildm/auth/policies)

3. **Postgres Version Upgrade** (Security)
   - Navigate to: Database ‚Üí Postgres Version
   - Upgrade to latest stable version
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Schedule maintenance window** - this requires brief downtime
   - [Upgrade Postgres](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xcvlijchkmhjonhfildm/settings/general)

4. **Function Search Path** (Security)
   - Already mostly handled in existing functions
   - Verify all functions have: `SET search_path TO ''` or `SET search_path TO 'public'`
   - [Review Functions](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xcvlijchkmhjonhfildm/sql/new)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è PHASE 2: MEDIUM SECURITY FIXES
**Timeline**: 1 day

### 2.1 Data Access Controls

#### Issue #5: Admin Data Access Too Broad (WARN)
**Risk**: All admins can view sensitive customer data
**Impact**: Insider threats, data leaks

**Fix**: Implement role-based access
```sql
-- Restrict order access to super-admins
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can select all orders" ON public.orders;
CREATE POLICY "Super admins can select all orders" ON public.orders
FOR SELECT USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.admin_users
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'super-admin'
  )
);

-- Same for contact messages, payments, etc.
-- Use get_masked_* functions for regular admins
```

#### Issue #6: Contact Form Rate Limiting (WARN)
**Risk**: No rate limiting at database level
**Impact**: Spam, DDoS, data harvesting

**Solution**: Already implemented `check_rate_limit` function - verify it's being used in contact form edge function.

#### Issue #7: Newsletter Email Harvesting (WARN)
**Risk**: Bulk access to subscriber emails
**Impact**: Spam lists, GDPR violations

**Fix**: Already has masked functions - ensure admin UI uses `get_newsletter_subscriptions_admin()` which logs access.

### 2.2 Audit Log Security

#### Issue #8: Audit Log Tampering (WARN)
**Risk**: Logs could be deleted, undermining security
**Impact**: Can't detect breaches, compliance failure

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Explicitly deny deletions
CREATE POLICY "Deny all audit log deletions" ON public.audit_logs
FOR DELETE USING (false);

-- Restrict inserts to system only
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System can insert audit logs" ON public.audit_logs;
CREATE POLICY "System can insert audit logs" ON public.audit_logs
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NULL); -- Service role only
```
